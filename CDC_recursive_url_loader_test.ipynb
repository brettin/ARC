The term super-spreader is used for multiple, and sometimes even conflicting, purposes. The reasons for this can be traced back to its complex history. Forerunners of the super-spreader concept—in discussions of so-called dangerous carriers and in analyses of explosive outbreaks during the early 20th century—revolved primarily around gastrointestinal diseases, not respiratory ones. In 1957 ... The extensive global burden is predominantly caused by six flaviviruses: dengue, Zika, West Nile, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis. Several vaccines have been developed, and many more are currently being tested in clinical trials. The wide distribution of accordant mosquito vectors in the world results in the pandemic transmission of these flaviviruses and increases the infection risk of human populations [ 12, 13 ]. Recently, epidemics of mosquito-borne flavivirus infections pose great concerns [ 6, 14] and are tremendous burdens on global public health systems [ 15 ]. Flaviviruses naturally circulate in enzootic interactions between their reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors (primarily mosquitoes), and are responsible for sporadic epidemics as well as established endemicity in certain geographic regions ( Figure 1) [ 2 ].\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mDo I need to use a tool?

      "Final Answer: The latest information on flavivirus outbreaks indicates that these viruses are predominantly spread by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes. Factors contributing to their spread include urbanization, climate change, and global travel. The term \"super-spreader\" has been historically associated with gastrointestinal diseases, but it also applies to outbreaks of diseases like flaviviruses. The most significant flaviviruses causing global health concerns are dengue, Zika, West Nile, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis. Vaccines exist for some of these viruses, and more are under development. Flaviviruses typically circulate between reservoir hosts and vectors, leading to sporadic epidemics and endemicity in certain regions. The role of asymptomatic carriers in the spread of flaviviruses is not explicitly mentioned in the search results, and historical modeling efforts were not detailed in the available information. For the latest CDC statistics on the current flavivirus outbreak, a specific search using the CDC's resources or databases would be required.\u001b[0m\n",
