It is related to West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Yellow fever virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of infected Aedes or Haemagogus species mosquitoes. Mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected primates ... Wastewater viral activity levels, an important tool used to detect increases of COVID-19 transmission in the community, are currently high and increasing in all regions. As of December 25, 2023, 66% of wastewater samples had JN.1 as the dominant variant, up from 58% the previous week. JN1.1 is not only rising in the United States, but globally ... The extensive global burden is predominantly caused by six flaviviruses: dengue, Zika, West Nile, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis. Several vaccines have been developed, and many more are currently being tested in clinical trials. Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease globally, with outbreaks becoming more frequent, more deadly and more widespread across diverse regions of the world. In 2017 alone, there were an estimated 100 million cases of Dengue infection across the world, 40,000 of which were fatal. The flavivirus genus contains several clinically important pathogens that account for tremendous global suffering. Primarily transmitted by mosquitos or ticks, these viruses can cause severe and potentially fatal diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis.
