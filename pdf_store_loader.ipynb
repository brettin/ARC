To date, data on mpox in \\ncisgender women and pregnant persons have been limited. Understanding transmission in these populations is critical for mpox prevention. In addition, among pregnant persons, Monkeypox virus can be transmitted to the fetus during preg-nancy or to the neonate through close contact during or after \\nbirth (2–5). Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including sponta-\\nneous abortion and stillbirth, have been reported in previous mpox outbreaks ( 3). During May 11–November 7, 2022, \\nCDC and U.S. jurisdictional health departments identified mpox in 769 cisgender women aged ≥15 years, representing \\n2.7% of all reported mpox cases.\\n† Among cases with available \\ndata, 44% occurred in cisgender women who were non-\\nHispanic Black or African American (Black), 25% who were \\nnon-Hispanic White (White), and 23% who were Hispanic \\nor Latino (Hispanic). Among cisgender women with available data, 73% reported sexual activity or close intimate contact as the likely route of exposure, with mpox lesions most frequently reported on the legs, arms, and genitals. T wenty-three mpox cases were reported in persons who were pregnant or recently \\npregnant\\n§; all identified as cisgender women based on the mpox \\ncase report form.¶ Four pregnant persons required hospitaliza -\\ntion for mpox. Eleven pregnant persons received tecovirimat, \\nand no adverse reactions were reported. Continued studies on \\nmpox transmission risks in populations less commonly affected \\nduring the outbreak, including cisgender women and pregnant persons, are important to assess and understand the impact of mpox on sexual, reproductive, and overall health.\\n* These authors contributed equally to this r eport.\\n† https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/demographics.html  \\n(Accessed November 7, 2022).\\n§ R ecently pregnant persons had confirmed or probable Monkeypox virus  infection \\nwithin 21 days of delivery.\\n¶ https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/health-departments/case-reporting.htmlData on confirmed and probable cases of mpox are electroni-\\ncally reported as part of national case surveillance through a standardized case report form or the National Notifiable \\nDiseases Surveillance System.** Data are collected by health \\ndepartments and include demographic characteristics, possible exposure routes, and signs and symptoms.

Among 10 cases in \\npregnant persons with information on trimester of infection, three occurred during the first, four during the second, and three during the third trimester (Table 3). Rash was present in all persons. Genital lesions were reported by four currently or recently pregnant persons; none reported genital lesions near \\nthe time of delivery.\\nEleven (48%) pregnant persons received tecovirimat \\n(administered during all trimesters of pregnancy); no \\nmedication-related adverse events were reported. Four preg-nant persons were hospitalized related to symptoms from \\nMonkeypox virus  infection (pain control and treatment of \\nsuperimposed cellulitis) and remained pregnant at discharge. \\nNo pregnant person required intensive care, intubation, or unplanned delivery. None of the pregnant persons received vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) for treatment.  \\nOf the 21 persons who received an mpox diagnosis during \\npregnancy, three have reported outcomes, including two full-\\nterm deliveries without complications (including no transmis -\\nsion to the infant) and one spontaneous abortion at 11 weeks’ gestation. T wo pregnant persons experienced mpox symptoms within 3 days after delivery; their newborns developed lesions \\nwithin 1 week of their symptom onset. Both newborns received \\noral tecovirimat within 48 hours of developing lesions and were treated for 10–14 days; one received VIGIV. Both newborns responded to treatment, appeared to be in good health, and were discharged home.\\n ††† CDC r ecognizes that not all pregnant persons are cisgender women. However, \\nin the study, all cases of mpox in pregnant persons, recently pregnant persons, \\nand breastfeeding persons occurred in persons who identified as cisgender \\nwomen based on the mpox case report form.One recently pregnant person who was breastfeeding devel -\\noped lesions 4 days postpartum, including under the breast; this \\nperson’s newborn developed symptoms with lesions on the face \\nand chest 6 days later. T wo other cisgender women who were \\nnot pregnant or recently pregnant were breastfeeding at the time of mpox diagnosis. One woman’s infant was exposed to a symptomatic household contact; she experienced symptoms 2 weeks after the infant’s diagnosis. The second woman received an mpox diagnosis following an occupational exposure; breast \\nmilk samples from this person were tested and were negative for \\nMonkeypox virus  DNA by polymerase chain reaction testing.\\n§§§\\nDiscussion\\nMonkeypox virus  infections in cisgender women during \\nMay 11–November 7 constituted <3% of total U.S. cases.

Consistent with disparities observed overall during the ongo -\\ning mpox epidemic, the proportion of Black and Hispanic women with mpox was higher than the proportion of Black and Hispanic women in the U.S. population ( 6). This finding \\nis similar to disparities among mpox cases in the United States overall and underscores the continued need for public health efforts to provide education on prevention of mpox and ensure \\nequitable access to mpox vaccination, testing, and treatment.\\nSex or close intimate contact within 3 weeks of symptom \\nonset was reported by nearly three quarters of cisgender women \\nwith mpox, and genital lesions were frequently reported, sug-gesting sexual exposure as a likely primary route of transmis-\\nsion. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers should \\nconsider mpox when examining new genital, oral, or breast lesions. Patient education regarding risks for transmission of Monkeypox virus  and other sexually transmitted infections \\nshould be provided.\\nGenital lesions in pregnant persons pose a risk for Monkeypox \\nvirus transmission to the fetus during vaginal delivery.\\n¶¶¶ A thor-\\nough skin and mucosal (e.g., anal, vaginal, and oral) examination for mpox lesions should be performed in persons with possible \\nmpox near the time of delivery to identify lesions of which they \\nmight be unaware. When mpox lesions, including genital lesions, are present, shared decision-making should be considered when discussing route of delivery. Because there might be an increased risk for severe disease in newborns, breastfeeding should be temporarily delayed until criteria for discontinuing isolation \\nhave been met (lesions have resolved, the scabs have fallen off, \\nand a fresh layer of intact skin has formed).****\\n \\n §§§ This br eastfeeding mother was a health care worker who cared for a \\nsymptomatic patient.

Public health efforts should include more emphasis \\non cisgender women who might be at increased risk for expo -\\nsure. In addition, although most reported cases of mpox in pregnant persons have been managed in the outpatient setting, some persons might require hospitalization, and there is a risk for perinatal transmission. To mitigate this risk, pregnant, \\nrecently pregnant, and breastfeeding persons should be offered \\nprophylaxis or treatment if indicated. Continued collection of information is critical to evaluating the risk for transmission, informing infection prevention and control, and assessing the impact of mpox on the sexual, reproductive, and overall health \\nof cisgender women. In addition, collection of longitudinal \\ndata among pregnant persons and their infants is critical to understanding the effects of mpox on maternal and neonatal outcomes.
